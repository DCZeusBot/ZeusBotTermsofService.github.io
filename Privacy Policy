## Policy Regarding Discord Terms of Service Violations and Bot Blacklisting

In the event of a violation of the Discord Terms of Service (ToS) resulting in the blacklisting of your bot from your server, the following policies will be enforced:

Bot Blacklisting:
If your bot is found to be in violation of the Discord ToS, it will be promptly blacklisted from your server. This measure is taken to maintain the integrity of our platform and uphold community standards.

## Premium Subscription Cancellation:
In the unfortunate event that your bot is blacklisted, any active premium subscriptions associated with it will be automatically canceled. This ensures that users are not paying for services rendered by a bot that is no longer compliant with Discord ToS.

## Refund Policy:
We regret to inform you that refunds will not be provided under any circumstances. However, should you wish to terminate the premium subscription, we will expedite the cancellation process upon receiving a formal request. This ensures a seamless resolution for affected users.

## Data Security Measures:
All user-related information, including names, email addresses, usernames, and user IDs, will be meticulously stored in a secure database. To fortify data security, the database password will undergo a weekly change, implementing a robust safeguard against potential breaches. In the event of a data breach, we will take immediate action to contact you and involve the appropriate authorities to prevent the sale of your data.

## Customer Support:
In the event of any issues or concerns, users have the right to contact our support team. We are committed to providing swift responses to ensure a timely resolution of any queries or problems that may arise.

We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in adhering to these policies, which are designed to create a secure and enjoyable environment for all users on our platform. If you have any further questions or require assistance, do not hesitate to reach out to our support team, and we will respond as promptly as possible.
